            This dashboard uses publicly available pet registration data to examine how pet ownership 
            varies across the cities of Geelong and Casey. It highlights where pets are most concentrated, 
            how dog–cat ratios differ by suburb, and how these patterns relate to age, breed and naming 
            trends. Together, the visualisations offer a clear picture of the cultural and behavioural 
            characteristics shaping pet ownership across both regions.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            The dashboard begins by examining the geographic distribution of pet ownership across Geelong and Casey. 
            Mapping pets per 1,000 residents highlights where pets form a larger part of household life 
            and reveals how pet-keeping culture varies from suburb to suburb. The map below provides an 
            overview of these spatial patterns before we explore age, breed and naming trends in later 
            sections.

                <p class="section-text">
                    The choropleth map compares how common pet ownership is across Geelong and Casey by measuring
                    registered pets per 1,000 residents.
                    This standardised rate reveals genuine differences in pet-keeping culture rather than simply
                    reflecting population size.
                    Darker shading highlights suburbs where pets form a noticeably larger part of household life.

                <p class="section-text">
                    Hover over any suburb to view cat and dog registration counts as well as the estimated
                    population. Comparing Geelong and Casey side-by-side reveals different spatial distributions:
                    Casey suburbs tend to show stronger contrasts between high and low ownership regions, while
                    Geelong displays a more gradual spatial gradient.

            The first map shows where pet ownership is concentrated, but it treats all pets as equal.
            In reality, some suburbs are far more dog-dominated, while others lean strongly toward cats.
            This difference tells us about the kinds of households living in each area from
            family-oriented, dog-heavy suburbs to apartment-dense neighbourhoods with more cats.
            <br><br>
            The following diverging map visualises this balance directly, showing whether dogs or cats
            are more common in each suburb, and by how much.

                <h2>Dog vs Cat Dominance by Suburb</h2>
                <p>
                    This smaller map focuses on the balance between dogs and cats in each suburb.
                    The diverging colour scale shows the log₁₀ ratio of registered dogs to registered cats:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blue</strong> suburbs have relatively more cats than dogs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Red</strong> suburbs have relatively more dogs than cats.</li>
                    <li><strong>White / pale shades</strong> indicate a more balanced mix.</li>
                    <li><strong>The more intense the shade is, the higher the ratio is respectively.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Because the ratio is shown on a log scale, extreme dog- or cat-dominated suburbs appear
                    more intensely coloured, while balanced suburbs sit near the centre of the colour scale.
                    This makes it easy to identify pockets of dog-leaning vs cat-leaning communities across both
                    councils.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="section-text">
                <br>
                <strong>Why no blue suburbs appear:</strong>
                Blue indicates areas where cats outnumber dogs. Although the colour scale includes blue to
                represent the full possible range, <strong>none of the suburbs in Geelong or Casey fall below zero on
                    the log₁₀(dogs/cats) scale</strong>.
                In other words, <strong>dogs outnumber cats in every suburb</strong>.
                The inclusion of blue in the legend reflects the complete scale used for the ratio, while its absence on
                the map highlights a genuine pattern in the data: across both regions, dog ownership is consistently
                more prevalent than cat ownership.
                <br><br>
                This ratio map complements the preceding population maps by showing not just where pet
                ownership is high, but which type of pet shapes each community. The following sections
                explore how these species differences relate to age profiles, breed popularity, and naming
                patterns.
            </p>
            <h2>Understanding Suburb-level Patterns in Context:</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                While the ratio map highlights how dog- and cat-dominance varies across individual suburbs, it is also
                important to interpret these patterns at a broader scale.
                The following charts step back from suburb-level detail to compare overall pet ownership between
                the two councils and to identify which suburbs have the highest concentration of pets per resident.
                Together, these views help contextualise the earlier maps and offer clearer insight into how local
                variations fit within the wider demographic landscape of Geelong and Casey.

                    of Geelong and Casey. It highlights the broader city-level differences in pet ownership
                    and provides essential context for interpreting the suburb-level trends shown in earlier maps.
                    Overall, both Geelong and Casey register substantially more dogs than cats, reinforcing the
                    consistent
                    dog-dominance seen across almost all suburbs in both councils.

                    ownership is particularly concentrated, regardless of suburb size.A notable pattern emerges:<strong>
                    8 out of the top 10 suburbs are located in Geelong</strong>, suggesting a higher density of pet-owning
                    households
                    compared to Casey and reflecting regional differences in lifestyle and housing patterns.

            Taken together, the suburb-level maps and city comparisons paint a clear picture of
            pet ownership across Geelong and Casey: both councils show strong dog dominance, and
            pet ownership is most concentrated in a small number of Geelong suburbs. These patterns
            reflect broader differences in population density, housing types and lifestyle
            preferences across the two regions. Having explored <strong>where</strong> pets are most
            common and how dogs and cats differ geographically, the dashboard now shifts focus to
            <strong>who</strong> these pets are: their ages, breeds and naming trends.

                    <strong>4 and 10 years</strong> across most popular breeds. Labradors,
                    Jack Russells, Maltese/Shih Tzus and Border Collies all show a strong band

                </p>

                <p class="section-text">
                    A strong human-name influence is visible: many top names (e.g., <strong>Oscar</strong>,
                    <strong>Archie</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Lily</strong>) are common baby names in
                    Australia.
                    This suggests that pets are often treated as family members and named much like children.
                </p>

                <p class="section-text">
                    Another clear trend is simplicity: most names are short (typically 4–6 letters) and easy to call
                    out.
                    There is also a noticeable mix of affectionate nicknames (<strong>Buddy</strong>,
                    <strong>Lulu</strong>, <strong>Bear</strong>) and classic pet names (<strong>Rex</strong>,
                    <strong>Shadow</strong>, <strong>Pepper</strong>).

            Beyond which names are most popular, it is also useful to look at how those names are
            structured. The next charts explore patterns in <strong>name length</strong> and
            <strong>initial letters</strong> to show how owners tend to shape and choose their pets’
            names.

            While the word cloud highlights which individual names are most popular, the next two charts
            look at how those names are formed, their <strong>length</strong> and the
            <strong>initial letters</strong> owners tend to choose. This helps reveal broader naming
            patterns across dogs and cats in Geelong.

                    The chart on the left compares how long pet names typically are for
                    <strong>dogs</strong> and <strong>cats</strong>. Bars show how many registered pets have
                    names of each length.

                <p class="section-text">
                    Most names fall between <strong>4 and 7 characters</strong>, reflecting a strong
                    preference for short, easy-to-call names. Dogs generally have slightly longer names than
                    cats, which more often have very short, nickname-style names.

                    The chart on the right shows which <strong>initial letters</strong> are most common.
                    Names beginning with <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong> and <strong>M</strong> are
                    especially popular, while unusual initials such as <strong>Q</strong>, <strong>X</strong>
                    and <strong>Z</strong> appear far less often.

                <p class="section-text">
                    Together with the word cloud, this suggests that most pets are given simple,
                    human-like names that fit everyday use.

            Together, these charts show that most pets are given simple, 
            familiar names: short (4–7 characters), easy to pronounce, and often starting with 
            common initials like B, C and M. Dogs tend to have slightly longer names than cats, 
            while unusual or very long names remain rare. Together, these patterns reflect a strong 
            preference for human-like, everyday names that are quick to call and widely recognisable.

        <h2>Summary & Key Insights</h2>

        <p class="section-text">
            Overall, the data shows that Geelong and Casey share many similarities in pet ownership, yet differ 
            in density, species balance and registration detail. Dogs dominate registrations across both cities, 
            with middle-aged pets being the most common and popular breeds showing clear age clusters. Naming 
            patterns further highlight a strong preference for short, human-like names that are easy to call. 
            Taken together, these insights reveal how geography, demographics and cultural preferences shape the 
            way households choose, identify and care for their pets.
